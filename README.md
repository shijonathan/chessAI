The preprocessed FEN data is contained in ``data_processed.npy.gz`` and ``results_processed.npy.gz``, containing the flattened $8\times8\times12$ one-hot encoding of the tensors and the labels, respectively. The notebook ``data.ipynb`` processes the data.

Running ``main.ipynb`` in order will give all of the corresponding figures in order from Figure 2 to Figure 13 in section 5 of the paper in order.
